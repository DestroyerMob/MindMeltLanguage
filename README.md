An esoteric language based on BrainF**k, Althouth slightly more powerful and useful
Allow's you to store and access registers whenever you want, altough you cannot directly edit these, you have set and get functions
Added the use of numbers, strings, and characters to be used in the language, this will allow code to be less janky
Removed the square bracket loops and they were a pain to both write and use, have now got tags, subroutines, and branches like assembly

Allow's the user to input numbers, strings, and characters into the program, and output them as well.
Added traps
Overall it's pretty much a blend of lc-3 and BrainF**k
